The following is a list of TODOs that we are hoping to implement before 
the next release:

  C = FIX Completed
  P = FIX In Progress

- Confusion on backupdays variable
- Atomic full backups.  Backup should only be considered successful if the script
  ran completey.
- Delete all temp files before run.
- Commandline backup reset (pass parameter to remove *.dat files)
- Supress tar output from STDOUT (done)
- Log file creation
P - Mail notifications
- Command line parameters to specify files/directories to backup
- Update man pages and documentation
C - Read the /etc/reoback/settings.conf by default
- Follow Mandrake's file locations (found in the mandrake rpms)
- Add support for SMB mounting, similar to NFS mounting
- Add option to backup subdirectories in separate archives
- Add configuration to change archive names
- Change message of deletions to specify what numbers were removed
- Remove default message of transer time if not doing remote backups
- Add config for absolute path of tar, date and other dependent 
  executables.
- Fix RPM package to set correct default values for run_reoback.sh, and 
  settings.conf
- Implement file locking to prevent multiple instances from overwriting 
  each others files.
- Implement perl regular expressions for file inclusions
C - "Transferring file..." message broken (doesn't display)
  due to filtering process, fix.
C - Change default permissions of settings.conf to 0600
- Add tarball filesize to output
- Add configuration for user/group owner of archive files, if ran as root
- Add configuration for FTP passive mode support (see forum suggestion)
C - Add SCP support.  A patch (passwordless SCP) is available in the mailing list 
  archive.  Need to change this to also support user/password authenticated transfers.
C - Commandline support to force full backups on every run.
