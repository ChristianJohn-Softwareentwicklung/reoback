I. Unpacking tar/gzip sources.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You can unpack the tar/gzip file with the following command:

   tar xvf reoback-1.0.tar.gz


----------------------------------------------------------------------
II. Installing the RPM package
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To install the RPM, simply type:

   rpm -ivh reoback-1.0-1.i386.rpm


----------------------------------------------------------------------
III. Configuration
----------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: If you installed using the RPM package, all configuration files are 
located at "/etc/reoback-1.0/conf/"

1. Edit the main configuration file "conf/settings.conf".  Each variable
   is explained in the file.

2. Edit the archive configuration file "conf/files.conf".  This is where 
   you define what files/dirs you want to backup.  An example is provided 
   in the file and also another example is listed here.  A few things to 
   remember:

       a.  Comments always start with "#", as such, they are not part of 
           the backup.
 
       b.  Keywords:
           "File:"  This defines a single archive.
	   "Skip:"  This defines a directory to skip.
 
       c.  All keywords (currently only, "File:" and "Skip:") can be 
           written in any case.

       d.  Example:
           File: Backup1
           /etc
           Skip: /etc/ted
           /home/tom
           /home/bill

           File: NewsBackup
           /var/www/html/news
           /var/www/html/newsinput.dat

           File: NewsArchiveBackup
           /var/www/html/newsArch

           # This is a comment :-)
           # The above list will back up /etc recursively, but will skip
           # the subdirectory /etc/ted
           # It will also include /home/tom, and /home/bill in the tar
           # file 'Backup1'

           # The tar file 'NewsBackup' will contain '/var/www/html/news'
           # and all subdirectories.  It will also include the file
           # /var/www/html/newsinput.dat

           # The tar file 'NewsArchiveBackup' will contain 
           # '/var/www/html/newsArch' and all subdirectories


----------------------------------------------------------------------
IV. Running the program
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To run REOBack, simply type:

   reoback.pl <configfile>

Where <configfile> is the full path of "settings.cfg".

For convenience, a file named "run_reoback.sh" is provided to run the 
program with one command.  It is recommended that you use this file if you 
plan on scheduling REOBack via cron.

For more information, please see the "README" file.  If you installed 
using RPM, the documention is located at /usr/share/docs/reoback-1.0/ and 
a man page is included and can be access by either:

   man reoback or man reoback.pl
